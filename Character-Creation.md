# Character creation  

To play DSA with your friends all players require a character in foundry.
If you already have existing characters you can transfer them manually to foundry. 
Just create a character, enter your experience level and copy all data to your character sheet.

If you do not yet have characters you can either use the prepared characters from the DSA Grundregelwerk module or create new ones with DSA in foundry.


## How do I create characters in Das Schwarze Auge?  

Go to the Actors Directory and create a new character:

If you have purchased the DSA Grundregelwerk modules, the character creation is based on the character creation explained in the core rulebook: 
1. First go to the Eigenschaften tab and enter APs for your character, e.g. 1100
