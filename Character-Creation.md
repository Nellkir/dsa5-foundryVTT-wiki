# Character creation  

To play DSA with your friends all players require a character in foundry.
If you already have existing characters you can transfer them manually to foundry. 
Just create a character, enter your experience level and copy all data to your character sheet.

If you do not yet have characters you can either use the prepared characters from the DSA Grundregelwerk module or create new ones with DSA in foundry.
