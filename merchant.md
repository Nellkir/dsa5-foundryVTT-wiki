## Merchant
* Set the multiplier for the buy and sell value for the merchant
* Don't forget to add money to trade
* You can add stuff in the same way like for normal sheets or you can use the random choice button

That's already it!

## Loot
* You can also set the sheet to "loot"
* Players can withdraw and store any item on a loot sheet

## Usage GM
To give access to Traders for your players make sure to give them the limited permission for that actor.
They can then access the trader via the actors directory or directly on a token on the map. 
Keep in mind that tokens on the map don't change the source actor in the actors directory. So you can reuse the same merchant/loot if the players only access it on the map.
Interaction with the trader is only available if a gm is logged in (due to permissions).

The GM can also use the "toggle limited view" button in the top right corner of the sheet to get the view that player's are going to have.

## Usage Players
Open the trader or loot sheet via the actors directory or a double click on the token on the map. You can then sell and buy stuff with the sell and buy buttons next to the commodities. A GM has to be logged in to use a merchant due to foundry permission configuration.
