## Creation of a familiar (witch*er)

To create a familiar you first have to create a *creature* via Create new actor ->. Alternatively you can import a creature from the core module (e.g. the cat).

After that you have to add the animal ability *Familiar* from the compendium special skills (item (dsa5-core)) to this creature.  
This automatically gives the creature the bonus stats of a familiar animal and allows it to be improved with adventure points:

**Note**: In order for the player to control this familiar themselves, they still need the *Owner* permission on the Actor.
A familiar as an extra token can lead to very funny situations :)
