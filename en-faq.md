## Foundry does not update its modules and game systems automatically. Therefore, check regularly if updates are available and install them.
Many problems can often be fixed with an update.

## How can I activate my purchased Foundry products at Foundry?
Open the page of [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) and log in with your Foundry account. Click on your name in the upper right corner of the page and then click on 
*Premium Content*. Here you enter your key, which you got from Ulisses (By mail and in the F-Shop under: *My Account* -> *Orders* -> click on *Show* when ordering). After that the module is available in Foundry under *Modules* (Category "Premium").

## How do I create a wizard/blessed one?
Basically you have to assign the advantage *blessed one* or *spellcaster* to your character. But this is not enough to see magic or religion in the character sheet. You have to add one of the following items to the character: magic/karmic special skill, spell, cantrip, ritual, liturgy, ceremony, blessing.
For more details, see the [Character Creation](https://github.com/Plushtoast/dsa5-foundryVTT/wiki/de-Charaktererstellung) and the [Character Sheet](https://github.com/Plushtoast/dsa5-foundryVTT/wiki/de-Charakterbogen). 

## Where can I ask questions or get support for problems?
Please leave an *issue* here on [Github](https://github.com/Plushtoast/dsa5-foundryVTT/issues) or come to [Foundry VTT's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt) and report to the ulisses-dsa channel. 

## I can't find my weapons under combat in the character sheet.
Make sure you have the weapons assigned under character's equipment. There you can equip the weapon for combat by placing a check mark in the *Shield* column. For details, check out the guide: [Character Sheet - Equipment](https://github.com/Plushtoast/dsa5-foundryVTT/wiki/de-Charakterbogen#5-ausr%C3%BCstung).  

## How can I create tokens that look like from the DSA books?
For that there is the module [Tokenizer](https://github.com/Plushtoast/dsa5-foundryVTT/wiki/de-Module#tokenizer).

## Why does the attribute adjustment of the species not change the attribute in the character sheet attributes?
According to the DSA rules, the attribute adjustment does not mean that this value is adjusted directly. It only adjusts the maximum value during character creation.
For example, if the character gets GE+1 from the species, he may directly improve this value to 15 instead of 14. For CH-2, the maximum during creation is 12.

## Changes of the skill values directly in the field are not counted towards the adventure points!
The input fields should give the player/game master full control over their values to be able to implement house rules etc. if necessary. This also allows you to work around possible mistakes in character creation in the short term. To calculate the AP, you must always use the +- buttons here.
