# Additional resources (tools, information, etc.)

The Dark Eye includes a lot of options and expansion rules. In order to make life easier for the players, various tools have been developed. We would like to present them here.

## Information
 - [TDE Rules wiki][1] - official WIKI for TDE. Constantly maintained, also contains references to publications. Language: German / English

## Tools
 - [Optolith Hero Management][2] - software for creating completely rule-compliant heroes, taking into account all rules available in the tool. (Works very well in combination with the module [optolith-to-foundry][5]. 
 - [Self-calculating hero sheet][3] - Complete hero sheet, which automatically calculates the AP. Complete, but complex (read instructions!). Does **not** check the requirements, so you have to know what you are doing / choosing. Language: German only (sad smiley face)
 - [The Dark Aid][4] - Character generator. Takes requirements into account, is bilingual. Superp tool, just the exportable PDF does not correspond to the official Ulisses document. Language: German / English
