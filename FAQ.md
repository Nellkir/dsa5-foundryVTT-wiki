Common culprits:
**Foundry is not automatically updating itself nor its content. Make sure you updated all your modules and the system to the latest version. This will already help in a lot of cases.**

## How can I unlock the premium content that I bought from Ulisses?
Go to the [Foundry Virtual Table Top](https://foundryvtt.com/) Website. Login to your account. Open your account profile (click on your name in the top right corner). Select "Premium Content" and enter the key provided by Ulisses. After that you can install the module via the module browser in your Foundry installation.

## How can I create a spellcaster/blessed one?
Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/Plushtoast/dsa5-foundryVTT/wiki/Spellcaster--and--Blessed-One-Creation).

## How can I get immediate support?
Please leave an issue on [Github](https://github.com/Plushtoast/dsa5-foundryVTT/issues) or join the [Foundry VTT's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt) and check out the ulisses-dsa channel.

## My weapons don't show on the character sheet
Make sure you are looking at the equipment tab, not the combat tab. Weapons only show up on the combat tab, if you actually equip them (like take them into your hands).

## Why does the attribute change of the species not add attribute levels on the character sheet?
This seems to be a common misunderstanding. The attribute change of the species only affects the maximum allowed rating of the attribute during the character generation, not the actual value itself. So you can advance with +2 AGI f.e. an attribute at the character generation to 16 instead of 14, but you still have to pay the adventure points.
