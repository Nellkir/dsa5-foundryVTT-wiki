## How can I unlock the premium content that I bought from Ulisses?
Go to the [Foundry Virtual Table Top](https://foundryvtt.com/) Website. Login to your account. Open your account profile (click on your name in the top right corner). Select "Premium Content" and enter the key provided by Ulisses. After that you can install the module via the module browser in your Foundry installation.

## My weapons don't show on the character sheet
Make sure you are looking at the equipment tab, not the combat tab. Weapons only show up on the combat tab, if you actually equip them (like take them into your hands).
