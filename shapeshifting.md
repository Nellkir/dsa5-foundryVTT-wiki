# Shapeshift
Shapeshifting will be available with the modules Gods of Aventuria or Aventurian Magic.

Shapeshifting requires the permission to create Tokens and Actors. For normal group setups only the GM is allowed to do that. So currently the GM should start and stop the shapeshifting process.
We might improve this once the feature is stable.


Simply drop a creature on the character sheet via drag and drop and follow the instructions. For players a new creature with merged attributes will be created in the actors directory. Also the token on the map gets replaced by the new creature.
Shifting tokens for NPCs and Creatures get a direct replacement on the map without a new Actor.

To undo the shapeshift rightclick in the status tab of the new creatures character sheet on the "shapeshift" status to delete it. The temporary actor will be destroyed and the creature will transform back to its origin.

You can also enable the module Token Magic FX for an animation during the shapeshift.
