# Combat  
TDE/DSA in Foundry includes a module for combat encounters. To start a combat encounter, player characters and NPC's need to toggle the Foundry combat mode.  
The combat mode can be activated by clicking the character token on the map and selecting the shield and sword Combat symbol.

In the combat encounter menu each player can roll initiative by clicking on the dice symbol next to their character's name.

DSA for Foundry will calculate your character's initiative for you and rank your character according to your initiative roll.  
Now each player can act according to their turn.

## Can I modify test/rolls?
Yes, all test rolls, in combat or anywhere else can be modified according to the core rules.  
  

## How can I attack, defend or evade during combat?
To attack, defend or evade during combat you can simply click on the button on your character sheet on the combat tab.

Alternativly you can enter the following commands into the chat box:
* attack: /at someText
* defend/parry: /pa someText

This will show you an auto-completion tab with the abilities of your current selected token (GM) or your own character (player). Just type in some part of the name of the weapon you want to use.


## Can special combat abilities be used in DSA for Foundry?
Partially. Special Abilities, if configured correctly, can be used and selected when attacking an opponent.  
Some Special Abilities are not yet available in the character sheet but we are adding more as time goes by - until then you need to calculate them manually.
